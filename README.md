This example demonstrates a subtle bug that can arise in Haskell when using flexible instances.  The code defines two instances of the `Show` typeclass for tuples: a general instance for `(a, b)` and a more specific instance for `(Int, String)`. The intention is to provide custom output for `(Int, String)` tuples. However, due to Haskell's flexible instance mechanism, the compiler might unexpectedly choose the general instance even when the specific instance should apply.  This can lead to incorrect output. The solution provides a way to avoid the ambiguity and ensure the correct instance is used.
